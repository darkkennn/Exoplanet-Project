# Exoplanet-Project
Based on the project made in NASA space apps hackathon 2023

Challenge: NASA Space Apps Challenge "Habitable Exoplanets: Creating Worlds Beyond Our Own"

Prediction Model:

To predict the planet type, accuracy, and planet type analysis using visualization of 3D graph with planet mass, planet radius, planet semi_major_axis, we can use the following Python libraries:

pandas: to read and manipulate the data
numpy: for mathematical operations
scikit-learn: for machine learning
seaborn: for data visualization
We can first use pandas to read the data into a DataFrame. Then, we can use numpy to calculate the planet type and accuracy. For the planet type analysis, we can use scikit-learn to train a machine learning model to predict the planet type based on the planet mass, planet radius, and planet semi-major-axis. Finally, we can use seaborn to create a 3D graph to visualize the planet type analysis.

Heat Map of Planet Temperature:

To create a heat map of planet temperature for habitability of an exoplanet, we can use the following steps:

Use pandas to read the data into a DataFrame.
Calculate the planet temperature using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
Use seaborn to create a heat map of the planet temperature.
My Habitable World

Based on the above analysis, my habitable world is a rocky planet that orbits a Sun-like star in the habitable zone. It is about 1.5 times the size of Earth and has a radius of 1.2 times that of Earth. Its temperature ranges from -50 to 50 degrees Celsius, which is similar to Earth's temperatureÂ range.

My habitable world has a thick atmosphere that is composed mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, with smaller amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases. The atmosphere is dense enough to protect the planet from harmful radiation from its star, but thin enough to allow sunlight to reach the surface.

The surface of my habitable world is mostly covered in water, with some landmasses. The oceans are teeming with life, and the landmasses are covered in lush forests and grasslands. The planet has a diverse ecosystem, with a wide variety of plants and animals.

Webpage:

To make this webpage we have used Kobweb which is an extension to kotlin to build webapps with ease!

In the app we have three pages;

Page 1: Welcome
Description: The first page of the webpage welcomes visitors with a beautiful and user-friendly design. It provides a brief introduction to the topic of exoplanets, enticing users to explore further. The page includes a captivating image of a distant galaxy to set the tone for the exploration that follows.

Page 2: What Are Exoplanets?
Description: On the second page, users will find a concise yet informative explanation of what exoplanets are. It covers their definition, characteristics, and their significance in the study of the cosmos. The page is designed to be visually engaging with the use of diagrams and images to help visitors grasp the concept easily. It also has NASA's blog on exoplanet attached so users can get an ever better description if they want to know more about Exoplanets in depth.

Page 3: My Exoplanet
The third page is dedicated to our own exoplanet. We've also provided detailed information about our hypothetical exoplanet, including its name, size, distance from its host star, and unique features. We'll also offer Python code descriptions that can be used to simulate various aspects of your exoplanet, such as its orbit, climate, or other intriguing properties. This page serves as a hands-on experience for users who are interested in the technical side of exoplanet exploration and coding.


## Prototype Design

We have created a detailed prototype of our Exoplanet Project using Figma, a collaborative interface design tool. You can view the interactive prototype by clicking the link below:

this consist of our Data analysis , Research,Predictions and many more
Feel free to explore the user interface, interactions, and design elements we have implemented for our project. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated!
